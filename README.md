## 🔥 Why This Project Matters

Most SaaS teams build fast, ship fast, and break fast.  
But they don’t have QA.  
This framework shows them exactly how a **senior QA automation engineer** protects their product, users, and revenue.

This project solves three major SaaS pain points:

### 1️⃣ *Regression failures after rapid releases*  
→ Solved with robust UI + API automation.

### 2️⃣ *Lack of QA team & expensive hiring*  
→ Solved with an automation architecture a single engineer can maintain.

### 3️⃣ *Poor or inconsistent bug reporting*  
→ Solved with AI-generated reports and risk-based suggestions.
